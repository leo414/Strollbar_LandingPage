We never know how places might change over time, but with Strollbar, you play a direct role in preserving the life of a place in photographic form. So when people pass by one day, they can say “Wow, that happened right here, years ago!” They’ll have you to thank.','<strong class="green">Joint Curator:</strong> Chances are you won’t be the only one taking a photo at a specific location. But that’s what makes Strollbar so cool! You’re like a curator who decides what aspects of daily life in a place should be shown to people who pass by. The more diverse the range of photo-content, the more interesting a place becomes as a site where so many different instances of the past can be seen.','<strong class="green">Photo Documentarian:</strong> The mission of all documentarians is to inform as many people as possible about whatever it is they’re documenting. The great thing about Strollbar is that we get to experience the world around us not only through the lenses of our friends but through the lenses of people we don’t even know. When you leave a photo on the spot for an unlimited number of people to pass by and check out, you’re doing the world at large a great favor. You’re not restricting the amazing thing you’ve captured to the eyes of your friends only. You’re saying, this photo, this moment preserved here in time, is for anyone who comes to see it.','<strong class="green">Explorer:</strong> The more photos you and others take through Strollbar, the greater the array of searchable content. The greater the array, the more surprises we encounter when checking these photos out. There could be photos near you right now! So put on your explorer’s hat and go take a look!','<strong class="green">Passerby:</strong> Strollbar treats photos as part of a place in the same way a single brick is part of a building: it not only stays put, but also contributes to a larger whole, the whole in this case being the collective history of a specific location. With Strollbar, you can check out a photo that’s part of the place you’re passing by, appreciate its relationship to this place, and go about your way.','<strong class="green">Participant:</strong> Imagine finding a photo of a bear along a hiking trail. Just like the photographer, your heart beats a little faster, you glance around, and you consider what’s ahead. In short, by being at the same place, you get to participate in some of the very same experiences as the photographer. What other app let’s you do that?'];
